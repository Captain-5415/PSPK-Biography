    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
    <p align="justify">Konidela Pawan Kalyan (born Konidela Sri Kalyan Kumar; 2 September 1971) is an Indian politician and actor, serving as the 11th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forest, Science and Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh as MLA representing the Pithapuram constituency. He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.</p>
    <p align="justify">As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following." He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012. He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.</p>
    <p align="justify">Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase. In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi. Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops. He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Both Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi held the record for the highest-grossing Telugu film of their era.</p>
    <p align="justify">Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate. In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration. He practices various martial arts, which he regularly showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He is known as the "Power Star" among his fans and the media. Kalyan is also recognized for his extensive philanthropic work, supporting various social causes. He has offered financial assistance to both individuals and organizations in need. In 2007, he established the charity Common Man Protection Force.</p>

    <h2 id="political-life">Political Life</h2>
    <p align="justify">Pawan Kalyan’s political life stands as a journey of persistence, ideology, and service. He entered politics with the creation of the Janasena Party in 2014, inspired by the belief that politics should be rooted in honesty, accountability, and trust. Unlike many actors who enter politics for power, Pawan pursued it as a mission to represent common people — especially the youth, farmers, and the underprivileged. His speeches gained massive attention for their clarity, emotional connect, and fearless criticism of corruption and injustice. Although Janasena did not achieve early electoral success, Pawan remained committed and never stepped away from public issues. He fought against illegal land deals, sand mafia, and human rights violations, and consistently raised his voice in the legislative and public forums.</p>
    <p align="justify">His resilience strengthened Janasena’s position, and with time, he gained significant public support. In the 2024 Andhra Pradesh elections, he played a decisive role in forming a historic coalition with TDP and BJP, resulting in a sweeping victory. His leadership, strategy, and mass connect turned Janasena into a powerful political force. With his election win from Pithapuram and his appointment as the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Pawan Kalyan’s political journey evolved from a dream to a movement — symbolizing hope, transformation, and people-first governance.</p>
